5. Research and Evidence

RRL:
Medicinal grasses have been used for a long time to help people with sickness and wounds. Gupta and Ranjan (2020) said that some
grasses have healing powers and can help with fever, stomach problems, and infections. Saha et al. (2014) found that some tribal 
people in India use grasses for cuts, coughs, and skin problems. Some examples of medicinal grasses are:

Cynodon dactylon (Bermuda grass) – used for stomach infections and wound healing.
Cymbopogon citratus (Lemongrass) – helps with fever, digestion, and cough.
Vetiveria zizanioides (Vetiver grass) – used for skin infections and cooling the body.

The United Nations (UN) 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) want people to take care of nature while helping others. Kumar et al. (2023)
said that using medicinal grasses can support SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) by giving natural medicine options and SDG 15 (Life on Land) 
by protecting plants. Technology is also important. They also explained that AI and apps can help people learn which plants are 
safe to use. The study also showed that cloud computing helps people get information fast and easy. If an app is made for medicinal
grasses, it can help people learn safely and use plants wisely, while keeping nature safe for the future.
