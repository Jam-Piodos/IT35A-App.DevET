NBSC RCO Calendar
________________________________________________________________________________________
Goals

This project aims to provide a centralized scheduling system for all Recognized Clubs and
Organizations (RCOs) at Northern Bukidnon State College (NBSC). It allows clubs and 
organizations to input their activities for the academic year within the designated timeframe. 
This ensures that events are well-organized, preventing conflicts and improving coordination 
between different groups.
________________________________________________________________________________________
Roles

The project will be a mobile/web application that serves as a digital calendar for all RCOs at NBSC. 
It will allow users to input, edit, and view their scheduled events. Notifications and reminders 
will be available to keep users updated on upcoming activities. The system will also provide a clear
and structured overview of all events to enhance campus-wide coordination.
________________________________________________________________________________________
Audience

This system is specifically designed for club officers, organization leaders, student members, and 
school administrators who need a structured platform to manage and track their activities efficiently. 
It will be beneficial for those who often face scheduling conflicts or difficulty in organizing events.
________________________________________________________________________________________
Situation

Managing multiple club and organization events can be challenging, often leading to overlapping schedules
and miscommunication. While some groups use traditional methods like paper calendars or messaging apps, 
these can be inefficient and unorganized. Existing calendar apps do not cater specifically to the needs of
school-based organizations. This system simplifies scheduling by centralizing event planning into one accessible
platform.

RRL:
Research supports the effectiveness of digital calendars in academic settings. Garcia & Martinez (2022) emphasize
that digital calendars improve event organization and reduce scheduling conflicts in educational institutions. Miller (2015) 
highlights that structured scheduling strategies increase student engagement and participation. Additionally, Salgado 
et al. (2023) found that effective event planning systems enhance student involvement in extracurricular activities, leading
to better academic and personal development. Using a digital scheduling system aligns with SDG 4 (Quality Education) by helping
students stay engaged in extracurricularactivities and SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure) by leveraging technology 
for better organization.
