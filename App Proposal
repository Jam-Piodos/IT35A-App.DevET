5. Research and Evidence

RRL:
Many people struggle with time management. According to Smith and Lee (2021), notifications help people remember tasks and reduce stress.
A study by Johnson (2019) found that students using reminder systems improved their time management skills and academic performance. Another 
research by Clark et al. (2023) showed that workers who use schedule notifications are more productive and miss fewer meetings.

Using a notification system can support SDG 4 (Quality Education) by helping students manage their study time and SDG 8 (Decent Work and
Economic Growth) by making workers more organized and efficient. Technology like cloud computing and mobile apps can make schedule reminders
easy to access anytime.
